 ### How's it going 😉
 I’m Mubashir Mohamed. Long name, I know, but you can call me Mubs :)
 ### 👀 I’m interested in:
 Many stuff. Learning Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. Intrested in C++ and C and wanting to make a programming language (My ambitions are too much, but worth a try).
 ### 🌱 I’m currently learning
 Learning Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. Soon to learn React and 3.js!
 ### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
 Mega real-world projects made with teams can be amazingly helpful.
 ### 📫 How to reach me?
 `Buck into the system, write some powerful code, find my computer specs and details, get my password and username after getting through a 1000 different firewalls, find my IP address, locate my other devices, get my personal info, find my place ID, and come over to me`
 Simple!
